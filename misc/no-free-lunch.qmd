title: Is the No Free Lunch Theorem (NFL) relevant in practice?
---
_The BBOBies, November 2025_

Let us consider the set of all (possible) functions $R^n\to R$ _discretized with two bytes_ per real number.[^discretenote] Let us call this set $F_n$.
The No Free Lunch Theorem[^wolpert] holds for this set of functions _because the set is closed under permutation._
The number of functions in $F_n$ is approximately[^funnumber]

$$|F_n| = \left(10^5\right)^{\left(10^5\right)^n} = 10^{5\times10^{5n}} = 10^{5\times 100000^{n}}$$


Let us put the size of $F_n$ into perspective.
The number of electrons in the universe multiplied by the number of Planck times passed since the beginning of time is about $10^{141}$.[^planck]
This number is minuscule compared to $|F_n|=10^{5\times 100000^{n}}$.
Hence, the number of real world functions, and in particular the number of real world functions we could _possibly ever encounter_ (and hence _could_ possibly be relevant to us) is minuscule compared the number of all $n$-dimensional low-discretized functions as given in $F_n$.

Does NFL hold for any practically relevant (and nontrivial) subset of $F_n$?
Does NFL hold for _any_ practically relevant set of nontrivial functions?
We don't know,[^knowing] but it looks exceedingly unlikely to us.[^subset]


[^discretenote]: As an example, this gives roughly 5 digits of precision for representing numbers from the interval $[0,1]$.
  In some practical situations we may require more precision or a wider range.
  Hence, the following size derivation is on the conservative side.

[^wolpert]: NFL states that aggregated over all functions, _all search algorithms perform identical_
  (given they do not revisit solutions), see @wolpert2002no.
  This is true if (and only if) the set of functions is closed under permutation.

[^planck]: The number of electrons (or atoms) in the universe is about $10^{80}$.
  The age of the universe is about $10^{18}$ seconds.
  The Planck time is about $10^{-43}$ seconds.
  The number of all electrons in the universe multiplied by the number of Planck times since the beginning of the universe is hence about $10^{80} \times 10^{61} = 10^{141}$.

[^funnumber]: The number of functions equals the number of different function values to the power of the number of different solutions.

[^knowing]: Given any observable set of nontrivial "continuous" _real world_ problems, it seems hard to conceive how we could ever determine that NFL holds for this set. 

[^subset]: In general, _any_ function subset is highly unlikely to obey NFL and any nontrivial neighbourhood is not invariant under permutation, see  @igel2005no.
