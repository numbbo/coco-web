title: COCO Data Archive
---

Here we provide the official benchmarking data archives from numerical benchmarking experiments run on the COCO platform. 
For each test suite we provide a listing of the official data sets with additional information like authors, links to papers, source code etc.
Data sets for the following test suites are available: 

* [bbob](bbob.qmd): 24 single-objective noiseless functions
* [bbob-noisy](bbob-noisy.qmd): 24 single-objective noisy functions
* [bbob-biobj](bbob-biobj.qmd): 55 bi-objective functions
* [bbob-largescale](bbob-largescale.qmd): large-scale version of the 24 bbob functions (dimension up to 640)
* [bbob-mixint](bbob-mixint.qmd): mixed-integer versions of the 24 bbob functions
* [bbob-constrained](bbob-constrained.qmd): 54 constrained functions with varying number of (non-linear) constraints

There is also a machine readable [JSON](data-archive.json) file with data from the experiments for programmatic access.
If you are using the [cocopp Python module](https://pypi.org/project/cocopp), the data is directly accessible "by name".
