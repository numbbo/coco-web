### F<sub>1</sub>: Sphere/Sphere {#F1}
Combination of two sphere functions ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal, highly symmetric, rotational and scale
invariant. The Pareto set is known to be a straight line and the Pareto
front is convex. Furthermore, the normalized hypervolume value of the
entire Pareto front with respect to the nadir point as reference point
can be computed analytically as the integral
$1-\int_{0}^{1} (1-\sqrt{x})^2dx = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{4}{3}=0.833333\ldots$.

Considered as the simplest bi-objective problem in
continuous domain.
Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.



### F<sub>2</sub>: Sphere/Ellipsoid separable {#F2}
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite)
and the separable ellipsoid function ([f<sub>2</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal and separable. While the first objective is
truly convex-quadratic with a condition number of 1, the second
objective is only globally quadratic with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about $10^6$.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.


### F<sub>3</sub>: Sphere/Attractive sector {#F3}
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite)
and the attractive sector function ([f<sub>6</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f06.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, but only the first objective is
separable and truly convex quadratic. The attractive sector
function is highly asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly $(1/2)^n$
yields low function values. The optimum of it is located at the tip
of this cone.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function group.



### F<sub>4</sub>: Sphere/Rosenbrock original {#F4}
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite)
and the original, i.e., unrotated Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>8</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f08.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

The first objective is separable and truly convex, the second
objective is partially separable (tri-band structure). The first
objective is unimodal while the second objective has a local
optimum with an attraction volume of about 25%.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function group.



### F<sub>5</sub>: Sphere/Sharp ridge {#F5}
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite)
and the sharp ridge function ([f<sub>13</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f13.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal.
In addition to the simple, separable, and differentiable first
objective, a sharp, i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be
followed for optimizing the (non-separable) second objective. The
gradient towards the ridge remains constant, when the ridge is
approached from a given point.
Approaching the ridge is initially effective, but becomes ineffective
close to the ridge when the ridge needs to be followed in direction
to its optimum.  The necessary change in *search behavior* close to
the ridge is difficult to diagnose, because the gradient
towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>6</sub>: Sphere/Sum of different powers {#F6}
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite)
and the sum of different powers function ([f<sub>14</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f14.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal. The first objective is
separable, the second non-separable.
When approaching the second objective's optimum, the difference
in sensitivity between different directions in search space
increases unboundedly.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>7</sub>: Sphere/Rastrigin {#F7}

and the Rastrigin function ([f<sub>15</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f15.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, the prototypical highly
multimodal Rastrigin function needs to be solved which has originally
a very regular and symmetric structure for the placement of the optima.
Here, however, transformations are performed to alleviate
the original symmetry and regularity in the second objective.

The properties of the second objective contain non-separability,
multimodality (roughly $10^n$ local optima), a conditioning of
about 10, and a large global amplitude compared to the local amplitudes.

Contained in the *separable - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>8</sub>: Sphere/Schaffer F7, condition 10 {#F8}
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f01.qmd) in the `bbob` suite)
and the Schaffer F7 function with condition number 10 ([f<sub>17</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f17.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, an asymmetric, non-separable,
and highly multimodal function needs to be solved to approach the Pareto
front/Pareto set where the frequency and amplitude of the modulation
in the second objective vary. The conditioning of the second objective
and thus the entire bi-objective function is low.

comparatively close to the corners of the unpenalized search area.

Contained in the *separable - weakly-structured* function group.



### F<sub>10</sub>: Sphere/Gallagher 101 peaks {#F10}

and the Gallagher function with 101 peaks ([f<sub>21</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd5) in the `bbob` suite).

While the first objective function is separable and unimodal,

of 101 optima with position and height being unrelated and
randomly chosen (different for each instantiation of the function).

Both objective functions are unimodal but only the first
one is separable. The first objective function, in addition,
is globally quadratic with smooth local irregularities, and
highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of about
$10^6$. The second objective function is highly
asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly $(1/2)^n$

the first objective function is unimodal, globally quadratic and ill-conditioned
with a conditioning of about $10^6$ with smooth local irregularities while
the second objective function is highly multimodal with roughly $10n$ local

Bent Cigar function ([f<sub>12</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f12.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$. The Ellipsoid function is globally quadratic with
smooth local irregularities while the Bent Cigar function deviates remarkably
from being quadratic due to an asymmetric transformation. To optimize the

ridge is approached from a given point. Approaching the ridge is
initially effective, but search behavior becomes difficult to diagnose
close to the ridge because the gradient towards the ridge does not flatten out.

The Discus function is globally quadratic with smooth local irregularities
and has a single direction in search space that is a thousand times more
sensitive than all others.
To optimize the Sharp Ridge function, a sharp (i.e. non-differentiable) ridge
has to be followed around which the gradient remains constant, when the
ridge is approached from a given point. Approaching the ridge is
initially effective, but search behavior becomes difficult to diagnose
close to the ridge because the gradient towards the ridge does not flatten out.

of about $10^6$ everywhere
with a single direction in search space that is a thousand times more
sensitive than all others, the sensitivities of the
$z_i$-variables (in the rotated search space)

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$.
The Bent Cigar function deviates remarkably
from being quadratic due to an asymmetric transformation and a smooth,
but very narrow ridge has to be followed to optimize it.
To optimize the Sharp Ridge function, in turn, the ridge to be followed
is even sharper (i.e. non-differentiable), around which the gradient remains
constant, when the ridge is approached from a given point. Approaching the ridge is
initially effective, but search behavior becomes difficult to diagnose

The problem's Rastrigin function alleviates the symmetry and regularity of
the originally proposed Rastrigin function via asymmetric and oscillating
transformations of the search space. It has roughly $10^n$ local optima,
a low conditioning, and the global amplitude of function values is large

Griewank-Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>19</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f19.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Compared to $F_{82}$, the only difference is the higher condition number of
about 1000 (compared to 10) in the Schaffer F7 function.

Contained in the *multimodal - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>84</sub>: Schwefel/Gallagher 21 {#F84}
Combination of the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd0) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Gallagher 21 function ([f<sub>22</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f22.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are multimodal with only a weak global structure.
The most prominent $2^n$ minima of the Schwefel function
are located comparatively close to the corners of
the unpenalized search area. The penalization is essential, as otherwise more
and better minima occur further away from the search space origin. The function
is furthermore partially separable, a kind of combinatorial problem, and has two
search regimes. The Gallagher function consists of 21 optima with position and
height being unrelated and randomly chosen (different for each instantiation
of the function). The conditioning of the Gallagher function around the global
optimum is about 1000.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.



### F<sub>85</sub>: Schwefel/Katsuuras {#F85}
Combination of the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd0) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Katsuuras function ([f<sub>23</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f23.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are highly multimodal with an exponential number
(in the dimension) of (global) optima and only a weak global structure.
The most prominent $2^n$ minima of the Schwefel function
are located comparatively close to the corners of
the unpenalized search area.
The Katsuuras function, in turn, is highly repetitive with more than $10^n$
global optima.



### F<sub>86</sub>: Schwefel/Lunacek bi-Rastrigin {#F86}
Combination of the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd0) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function ([f<sub>24</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f24.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are highly multimodal with only a weak global structure.
While the most prominent $2^n$ minima of the Schwefel function
are located comparatively close to the corners of the unpenalized search area,
the Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function has two superimposed funnels. Presumably,
different approaches need to be used for 'selecting the funnel'
and for searching the highly multimodal function 'within' the funnel.
The single-objective Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function was constructed
to be deceptive for some evolutionary algorithms with large population size.

Contained in the *weakly-structure - weakly-structured* function group.



### F<sub>87</sub>: Gallagher 101/Gallagher 21 {#F87}
Combination of Gallagherâ€™s Gaussian 101-me Peaks function ([f<sub>21</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd5) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Gallagherâ€™s Gaussian 21-hi Peaks function ([f<sub>22</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f22.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are multimodal and non-separable. Both consist of a set of
optima with position and height being unrelated and randomly chosen. The number of
optima is 101 and 21 respectively and the condition number around the (unique) global
optima are about 30 and about 1000 respectively.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.



### F<sub>88</sub>: Gallagher 101/Katsuuras {#F88}
Combination of Gallagherâ€™s Gaussian 101-me Peaks function ([f<sub>21</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f02.qmd5) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Katsuuras function ([f<sub>23</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f23.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal with
only a weak global structure. Gallagher's Gaussian 101-me Peaks
function consists of a set of 101 optima with position and height being
unrelated and randomly chosen. The conditioning is about 30.
The Katsuuras function, in turn, is highly repetitive with more than $10^n$
global optima.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.

Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function ([f<sub>24</sub>](/testsuites/bbob/functions/f24.qmd) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal with
only a weak global structure. Gallagher's Gaussian 101-me Peaks
function consists of a set of 101 optima with position and height being
unrelated and randomly chosen. The conditioning is about 30.
