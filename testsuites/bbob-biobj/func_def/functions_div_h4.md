<h4><a name="F1"></a>F<sub>1</sub>: Sphere/Sphere</h4>
Combination of two sphere functions ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal, highly symmetric, rotational and scale
invariant. The Pareto set is known to be a straight line and the Pareto
front is convex. Furthermore, the normalized hypervolume value of the
entire Pareto front with respect to the nadir point as reference point
can be computed analytically as the integral
$1-\int_{0}^{1} (1-\sqrt{x})^2dx = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{4}{3}=0.833333\ldots$.

Considered as the simplest bi-objective problem in
continuous domain.
Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.

objective is only globally quadratic with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about $10^6$.

and the attractive sector function ([f<sub>6</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=30) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, but only the first objective is
separable and truly convex quadratic. The attractive sector
function is highly asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly $(1/2)^n$
yields low function values. The optimum of it is located at the tip
of this cone.

<h4><a name="F5"></a>F<sub>5</sub>: Sphere/Sharp ridge</h4>
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)
and the sharp ridge function ([f<sub>13</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=65) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal.
In addition to the simple, separable, and differentiable first
objective, a sharp, i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be
followed for optimizing the (non-separable) second objective. The
gradient towards the ridge remains constant, when the ridge is
approached from a given point.
Approaching the ridge is initially effective, but becomes ineffective
close to the ridge when the ridge needs to be followed in direction
to its optimum.  The necessary change in *search behavior* close to
the ridge is difficult to diagnose, because the gradient
towards the ridge does not flatten out.

In addition to the simple sphere function, the prototypical highly
multimodal Rastrigin function needs to be solved which has originally
a very regular and symmetric structure for the placement of the optima.
Here, however, transformations are performed to alleviate
the original symmetry and regularity in the second objective.

The properties of the second objective contain non-separability,
multimodality (roughly $10^n$ local optima), a conditioning of
about 10, and a large global amplitude compared to the local amplitudes.

In addition to the simple sphere function, an asymmetric, non-separable,

front/Pareto set where the frequency and amplitude of the modulation
in the second objective vary. The conditioning of the second objective
and thus the entire bi-objective function is low.
