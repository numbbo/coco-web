title: Algorithm data sets for the `bbob-boxed` test suite
---

In the table below, you will find all official algorithm data sets on the bound-constrained `bbob-boxed` 
test suite, also known originally as `sbox-cost`, together with their year of publication, the authors, 
and related PDFs for each data set. Links to the source code to run the corresponding experiments/algorithms 
are provided whenever available.

To sort the table, simply click on the table header of the corresponding column.

Note that a manual download of the data is not necessary if you use the
[displaying results module (cocopp)](../../getting-started#postprocess) 
of COCO.
