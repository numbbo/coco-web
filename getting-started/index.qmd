title: Getting started with COCO
---

COCO is a framework for benchmarking optimization algorithms
and is divided into two main parts which can be used independently:

### Running an algorithm on a COCO benchmark suite: [Getting started](experiment-python.qmd)
  - *In Python:* go to [Getting started---Benchmarking an algorithm (collecting data) with Python](experiment-python.qmd).
  - *In other languages:* this usually (currently) requires to make a local clone of [github/numbbo/coco-experiment](https://github.com/numbbo/coco-experiment) and run `scripts/fabricate` (see the build instructions [here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco-experiment/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)) _and_ follow the instructions in the respective subfolder of [`code-experiments/build`](https://github.com/numbbo/coco-experiment/tree/main/build).

### Displaying COCO results (postprocess): [Getting started](postprocess.qmd)
Go to [Getting started--Analysing and comparing results (postprocess)](postprocess.qmd).
