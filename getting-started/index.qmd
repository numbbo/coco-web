title: Getting started with COCO
---

COCO is a framework for benchmarking optimization algorithms
and is divided into two main parts which can be used independently.

### [Getting started: running an algorithm on a COCO benchmark suite](experiment-python.qmd)
  - *In Python:* see [Getting started---Benchmarking an algorithm (collecting data) with Python](experiment-python.qmd).
  - *In other languages:* see the instructions in [`code-experiments/build`](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/tree/master/code-experiments/build) _and_ in the respective subfolder. This usually requires to make a local clone of [github/numbbo/coco](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) and run `scripts/fabricate`, [see here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### [Getting started: displaying COCO results (postprocess)](postprocess.qmd)
See [Getting started--Analysing and comparing results (postprocess)](postprocess.qmd).
