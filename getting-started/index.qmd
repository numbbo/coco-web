title: Getting started with COCO
---

The COCO framework is divided into two parts which can be used independently:

1. Running an algorithm on a COCO benchmark suite and thereby collecting performance data for this algorithm, see [Getting started---Benchmarking an algorithm](experiment-python.qmd) to get started with benchmarking an algorithm.
2. Displaying COCO results via the postprocessing, in particular comparing algorithms from or with the [data archive](/data-archive), see [Getting started--Analysing and comparing results](postprocessing.qmd) to get started with displaying benchmark data.
