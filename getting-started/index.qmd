title: Getting started with COCO
---

The COCO framework is divided into two parts which can be used independently.

## Running an algorithm on a COCO benchmark suite
  - In Python: see [Getting started---Benchmarking an algorithm (collecting data) with Python](experiment-python.qmd).
  - In other languages: see the instructions in [`code-experiments/build`](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/tree/master/code-experiments/build) and in the respective subfolder. (This probably requires to make a local clone of [github/numbbo/coco](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) and run `scripts/fabricate`, [see here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).)

## Displaying COCO results via the postprocessing
See [Getting started--Analysing and comparing results (postprocessing)](postprocessing.qmd).
