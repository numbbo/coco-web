Benchmarking a novel algorithm is divided into two parts:

1. Running the benchmark to collect performance data for the algorithm
1. Postprocessing those results and comparing them to other algorithms from the [data archive](/data-archive).

If you're only here to analyse and compare existing algorithms, you can skip straight to [step 2](#step-2-analysing-and-comparing-results).


## Step 1: Collecting data

## Step 2: Analysing and comparing results
